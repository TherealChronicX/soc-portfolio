# Raw Notes – Diamond Model

## Key Concepts
- **Adversary Operator:** Person/group carrying out the intrusion.  
- **Adversary Customer:** Entity benefiting from the intrusion.  
- **Victim Personae:** Target individuals/organizations.  
- **Victim Assets:** Attack surface (systems, IPs, emails, domains).  
- **Capability:** Malware, exploits, phishing campaigns, tools.  
- **Adversary Arsenal:** Collection of all attacker capabilities.  
- **Infrastructure:**
  - Type 1 → Owned by attacker.  
  - Type 2 → Intermediary (compromised domains, emails, servers).  

## Meta-Features
- **Phase:** Recon → Exploitation → C2 → Actions.  
- **Result:** Success / Failure / Unknown.  
- **Resources:** Tools, infra, knowledge, or access required.  
- **Others:** Timestamp, Methodology, Direction.  

## Q&A Answers
- Operator = malicious actor.  
- Customer = beneficiary of attack.  
- Arsenal = full attacker toolset.  
- Type 2 infra = malicious domains, compromised emails.  
- Type 1 infra = adversary-owned infra.  
- Phase meta-feature = sequential actions.  
- Result meta-feature = outcome label.  
- Resources meta-feature = external elements needed for success.  

## Takeaways
- Diamond Model = 4 corners: **Adversary, Capability, Infrastructure, Victim**.  
- Meta-features enrich analysis for timing, methodology, resources, outcomes.  
- Great for communication between SOC analysts and management.

# MITRE Framework Case Report

## Overview
- **Case:** MITRE ATT&CK®, CAR, Engage, D3FEND, AEP  
- **Date:** 2025-08-27  
- **Objective:** Understand MITRE resources (ATT&CK, CAR, Engage, D3FEND, AEP) and apply them to defensive & offensive security workflows.

---

## Evidence & Queries
- **ATT&CK Matrix:** Technique ID **T1566** (Phishing)  
- **Detection Sources:** `mail server,network traffic content,network traffic flow`  
- **APT Groups using spearphishing:** **APT1, APT12**  
- **Associated Groups (APT1):** Comment Crew, Comment Group, Byzantine Hades  
- **Software Example:** WEBC2 → *family of web shells used by APT1*  
- **Overlap:** APT16  

- **CAR Analytic Example:**  
  - ID: **CAR-2014-11-004** (Remote PowerShell Sessions)  
  - Tactic: **Persistence (TA0003)**  
  - Extra Analyst Info: **Coverage** (telemetry required)  

- **Engage Matrix:**  
  - SAC0002 → **Threat Model**  
  - Resource → **Threat Modeling Starter Kit**  
  - Engagement activity baiting response → **Elicit**  

- **D3FEND:**  
  - First ATT&CK Lookup: **T1001 Data Obfuscation**  
  - Produces: **Obfuscated files or information**  

- **Adversary Emulation Plans:**  
  - APT3 Phase 1: **Spearphishing Attachment**  
  - Persistence Binary Replaced: **sethc.exe → cmd.exe**  
  - APT29 Scenario 1 C2 Frameworks: **Cobalt Strike, Meterpreter**  
  - APT29 Scenario 2 C2 Framework: **PupyRAT**  
  - Sandworm Scenario 1 Webshell: **China Chopper (S0020)**  

- **Threat Intelligence (Aviation Sector):**  
  - Group: **APT41**  
  - Cloud Technique: **Credential Access (Cloud Services)**  
  - Tool: **Mimikatz**  
  - Mitigation: **MFA with SMS**  
  - Platforms: **Windows, SaaS, IaaS**

## Findings / IOCs
- ATT&CK IDs & mappings highlight common phishing & persistence techniques (T1566, T1036.005, TA0003).  
- APT1 and APT41 groups actively use spearphishing and credential access.  
- Multiple C2 frameworks observed (Cobalt Strike, Meterpreter, PupyRAT).  
- Tools like WEBC2 and Mimikatz commonly leveraged.  

---

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
- **Initial Access:** Spearphishing (T1566)  
- **Persistence:** Scheduled Tasks, Service Creation, Web Shells  
- **Credential Access:** Mimikatz dumping LSASS  
- **Command & Control:** HTTP/HTTPS beaconing, DNS tunneling  
- **Exfiltration:** Cloud credential theft, C2 exfiltration

## Lessons Learned
- MITRE ATT&CK is not just for defenders (Blue team) — also vital for Red and Purple team ops.  
- CAR provides analytics that expand on ATT&CK’s Detection/Mitigation summaries.  
- Engage introduces deception/denial concepts to bait attackers.  
- D3FEND complements ATT&CK by mapping defensive countermeasures.  
- AEP Emulation Plans allow structured red-team tests based on real APT groups.  
- Threat Intelligence (CTI) should always align ATT&CK techniques with industry sector risks (e.g., aviation + cloud).
